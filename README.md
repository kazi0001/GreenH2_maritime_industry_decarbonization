# Abstract
A green H2 economy’s practicality depends highly on multisector decarbonization and cost–benefit analyses of the supply chain, including production routes, techno-economic performance, storage, and transportation. In this work, a strategic methodology is used to formulate the multiobjective optimization problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to optimize green H2 economy scenarios for decarbonizing the industrial and marine sectors concurrently. GAMS/IBM ILOG CPLEX 30.3.0 solver was used to solve the MILP, and an RNN-LSTM prediction model was used to identify the future H2 demand from the maritime sector. Capital budgeting and sensitivity analysis were conducted for a constant 5% industrial sector decarbonization target and variable scenario-based maritime sector decarbonization. The results provide the detailed cost–benefit and trade-offs analysis for the optimal supply chain elements. The findings of this study can help define the essential legislative changes required to promote green H2 as a marine fuel.
